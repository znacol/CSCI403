													8/28/15

Dabatase Management System (DBMS) Fundamentals:
	- self describing data
	- program-data separation (independence in book)
	- data abstraction
	- network/multiuser access (transaction control)
	- client/server architecture

History- Early Models
	- pre-1960s
	- 1962: term "database"
	- 1964: GE's IDS by Charles Bachman (Turing Award 1973)
		- network model
			- records	record-type
			- sets		set-type
		- CODASYL- standard in 1969
	- 1966-68: IBM's IMS (Information Management System for Apollo)
		- first hierarchial model DB
	- navigational model: both IDS and IMS
	- 1970: relational model (IBM's E.F. Codd)
	- 1977: System R (IBM)- SEQUEL -> SQL
	- 1977-79: Oracle
	- 1973: INGRES- Berkeley- Michael Stonebraker & Eugene Wong
		- 1985: Postgres

	1960: navigational databases
	1970: relational model
	NoSQL
		- scalability
		- flexibility (JSON, XML)
		- fault tolerance
Relational Databases
	- Rows are called tuples
	- A relation is a set of tuples
	-** Tuple: collection of named/ordered values ('CPW', 'CSCI 403', 'Database Management', 3)
		- Attribute names: 		    (INSTRUCTOR, COURSE ID, TITLE, HOURS)
		- Domain: dom(INSTRUCTOR) = 'string'
			- may include NULL
	-** Relation schema:
		- R = R(A1, A2, ..., An)
		- Set of attributes to store in relation
		- R has degree n
		- Ai has domain dom(Ai)
	-** Relation (a.k.a. relation state):
		- A set of tuples consistent with relation schema
		-r(R) is a subset of (dom(A1) * dom(A2) * ... * dom(An)

	Note: "relation is a set" -> no ordering of tuple in relation
		also -> no duplicates (* in practice)
	Note: "attributes are set" ->ordering of sttributes in a relation doesn't matter
