				\begin{itemize}
				\item	
					Seek time: moving read-write head (9 ms)
				\item
					Rotational latency: data moving into position under r/w head (2 ms)
				\end{itemize}
			\item
				Access time: ~ 10 ms
			\item
				Blocks: fixed size chunk of data: ~512 bytes - 16 kb
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection*{File Organization}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
				Storing a relation on disk
			\item
				Many options:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
					Structured storage
				\item
					Unstructured ("heap") storage
			\end{itemize}
			\item
				Ordered Storage
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						Within blocks order primary key
					\item
						Blocks recorded in PK order
					\item
						Reads: lookup by binary search; $O(log_2(n))$
					\item
						Inserts: expensive; easier if maintain some empty space
					\item
						Deletions: similar
				\end{itemize}
			\item
				Analysis
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
				\end{itemize}
			\item
				B-trees
				\begin{itemize}
					\item
						Balanced search tree
					\item
						'large' number of entries per node $\equiv$ large number of children of each node
					\item
						Def of B-tree of order m
						\begin{enumerate}
							\item
								Every node has at most m children
							\item
								Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least $\frac{m}{2}$ children
							\item
								The root has at least 2 children (unless a leaf)
							\item
								A non-leaf node with k children has k-1 leaves
							\item
								All leaves appear on some level
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{itemize}
